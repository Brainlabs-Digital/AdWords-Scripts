## broad-match-keyword-aggregating.js

I mean, the name kind of speaks for itself. But this is all about broad match bidding, which is great but can lead to some misleading account performance data. The same words in a different order don’t produce the same performance. Our script embraces this fact, and does something about it.

## campaign-audience-copying.js

It’s a massive time-saver. Instead of doing it yourself, it just sort of happens by magic. The magic of code. And now you can take things to the next level: from campaign-level to meta-campaign-level. To a PPC superhero, that’s exciting right?

## copy-labels-between-levels.js

This is a rare occasion where we will talk about SEO a little. Not usually our thing. We’re all about PPC. This script lets you label keywords based on organic rank data, which means you can see how SEO is affecting PPC. I guess it’s good to know. But PPC is the king, don’t forget it.

## duplicate-ad-detector.js

One day, instead of saying ‘finding a needle in a haystack’ they’ll be saying ‘finding a duplicated ad in an AdWords account’. Possibly. Or maybe not – if everyone uses this script, and lets automation do all the searching for you. No more duplicates, therefore more accurate testing and far less complication. Nice.

## dynamic-ad-extensions.js

Ad extensions are good. Updating ad extensions manually is bad. Hence this script, which automates ad extension updates. Imagine your extension is about price – those change all the time. Or you want to be topical, like when it’s Pancake Day or something, and then the day after it’s Valentine’s Day. Pretty time-consuming? Not with this beauty!

## empty-ad-group-filler.js

What good is an ad if it’s empty? It’s no good. And yet every PPC-er has empty ad groups on their conscience – it’s hard to avoid if you rely on mere human intelligence. That’s why we made this script: using automation we can avoid ever having an empty ad group again, and therefore capitalise on as much search traffic as possible!

## extension-and-list-copying.js

As always, this is just a much faster way of managing your account. But also, this script will ensure that you don’t accidentally use different URLs for the same ad copy. That happens more than people imagine, and boy can that mess with your performance. So, get your AdWords extensions in good order with this script.

## keywords-for-shopping.js

Google Shopping is a great feature, but pretty imprecise in terms of keyword bidding. In default mode, you just give Google a feed of products and hope it syncs up nicely with queries. So instead of this rather blunt approach, we’ve made a script to give you much greater control over your keywords.

## make-exact-match-exact.js

Well, sometimes you want exact match to be exact. You know, so that you can show ads to people that are really really keen on seeing your ad, rather than sort of keen. It can make a real difference to CTR and CPC, so why wouldn’t you want this option to still be there??
